# BBAI-SHARED-MEM [Work in Progress]
Code to share memory between the ARM and the PRU on the Beaglebone AI.
__ This has been developped for the BBAI TIDL image: 4.14.108-ti-r131 __ There 
are changes in newer images: the call to remoteproc are done differently, the 
PRUs names are also different. However, at the time 4.14.108-ti-r131 is 
what you get if you use the recommanded images from the BeagleBone Foundation 
[website](https://beagleboard.org/latest-images), so I have been using this 
image.

## How to use the codes?
[TODO]

## Structure of the repository? 

[TODO]
The project is composed of different folders:
- [pru_codes](pru_codes/):  
- [user_space](user_space/):
